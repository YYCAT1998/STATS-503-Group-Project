### Thesis
**Artworks Classification Problem**

This project presents different methods for artworks classification problem
with a dataset that contains 4299 images of artworks belonging to 11 different
artists. The dataset is from Kaggle. We implement data preprocessing, and then fit several tree-based models,
Support Vector Classifier and pretrained Neural Network (CNN) model Resnet50
to classify the images into 11 classes. We compare the performances of the models
and finally achieved a test accuracy of 92.73% with the pretrained Resnet50
model.
